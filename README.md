# Problem Statement


The Janardan Prasad Memorial Multipurpose Social Service Society (JPMMSS) aims to empower rural artisans by promoting their crafts through platforms like Amazon and exhibitions. Currently, JPMMSS faces challenges managing inventory with Excel and requires an intuitive application for retail buyers and wholesalers. This application needs to feature comprehensive SKU listings, intuitive filtering, and a user-friendly backend for artisans to upload product details easily. Addressing these needs will streamline operations, enhance market reach, and empower artisans while preserving traditional crafts and improving socio-economic conditions in rural communities.

# <strong>Our Solution</strong>

To enhance sales performance and adapt to evolving market trends and consumer behavior, a comprehensive approach is necessary. Initially, conducting a SWOT analysis of the existing sales strategy will identify current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Leveraging strengths such as established customer trust and product quality, new strategies can focus on targeted marketing campaigns, innovative sales promotions, and enhanced customer engagement initiatives. Continuous updates on new products and business developments via email will keep customers informed and engaged, fostering loyalty and attracting new prospects. By aligning these strategies with market insights and consumer preferences, the organization can optimize its sales strategy, capitalize on opportunities, and mitigate potential threats, ultimately driving sustainable growth and competitive advantage.
